*"Hard-drives spinning, memories compressed and spat out in the dark spaces of a semi-compressed storage device."*

After his critically acclaimed debut release *ScanDisk* (read on [The Quietus](https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/partial-defrag-scandisk-review/) & [NINA Staff Pick](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/articles/partial-defrag-scandisk)), Partial Defrag is returning on STRATA with *Memory Recoil*. Moving from swirling sound design to teetering piano motifs, Memory Recoil ventures deeper into the heart of the hard-drive, where the haunted remnants of forgotten memories are mechanically re-combined into uncanny heart-felt confabulations.
